Apodis Pharma is an innovative company providing several B2B services for over a thousand French pharmacies. 

With my team of 10+ frontend and backend developers and designers, we developed a Symfony-based custom store for pharmacies supporting the [Pharma-ML XML standard](https://www.csrp.fr/documentation/pharma-ml) with an advanced cost and discount calculation system. Apodis was also providing a lot of KPIs, metrics and forecasts to support the activity of their customers, based on the processing of a large amount of sales data coming from the pharmacies' ERP.

All the applications we built during those years helped Apodis raise 7Mâ‚¬.
