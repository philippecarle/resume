Philippe is solution-oriented, trying to find the best compromise between the technical debt and the impact on the business.\nOn another side, Philippe is eager to bring continuous improvement on both technical and non-technical side of the job. For instance, we worked together on building templates to ease collection of functional requirements.\nHe is a very good point of contact for the team even if he is not their manager.\nHe voices topics no matter if they are good or bad so we can sit around the table and identify ways to improve or grab opportunities. He is very dedicated to make things work.\nAs an ex IT Tech person, I like to discuss design and technology with Philippe. He is very knowledgeable, with a DevOps approach of things: we build things to make them stable and smooth to operate and improve. He is used to cover functional specifications through, design, implementation, CI/CD, release management, communication... \nHe is constantly investing on improving his toolbox - for instance he recently attended to Scrum Master trainings to go deeper on that aspect of the job.\nIn short words, Philippe is a passionated and invested expert in web applications, with a very human approcach focusing on making things better, smoother and more sustainable."

He found time to teach me more about php and routing when I was struggling to understand parts of our technological stack and to listen to me when I had a different opinion about the best way to develop a solution. \nI know he was doing the same thing for everyone on the team but still never missed a meeting nor an important deadline despite the complicated and often tough environment. \nThe team grew stronger thanks to him and I will happily work with him in the future if the opportunity presents itself."
