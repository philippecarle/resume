For instance, we worked together on building templates to ease collection of functional requirements.\nHe is a very good point of contact for the team even if he is not their manager.\nHe voices topics no matter if they are good or bad so we can sit around the table and identify ways to improve or grab opportunities. He is very dedicated to make things work.\nAs an ex IT Tech person, I like to discuss design and technology with Philippe. He is very knowledgeable, with a DevOps approach of things: we build things to make them stable and smooth to operate and improve. He is used to cover functional specifications through, design, implementation, CI/CD, release management, communication... \nHe is constantly investing on improving his toolbox - for instance he recently attended to Scrum Master trainings to go deeper on that aspect of the job.\nIn short words, Philippe is a passionated and invested expert in web applications, with a very human approcach focusing on making things better, smoother and more sustainable."
